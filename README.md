# Rubik's Cube
This project is part of the final exam of the course on Computer Graphics at Politecnico di Milano.  
The aim is to explore and use GLSL using OpenGL(Open Graphics Library[3]) that is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

The project is a 3D web application reproducing the Rubik's Cube, in which the user can play with shaders and lighting and fully customize the environment.
